# Ketan Goyal . Jarvis Consulting

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science Engineering at Chandigarh University in India and a Post-graduation diploma in Business Analysis from Conestoga College, Kitchener, Canada. Prior to attending university I was fascinated with technology and focused on mathematics and science in high school. Technical training and natural business acumen helped me get a Business Analyst role at Infowiz in India (based out of California) working with North American clients. I'm currently working at Jarvis as a Business Analyst where I am responsible for preparing documentation for many projects, handling signoffs, holding kickoff meetings, and creating wireframes for UI/UX while managing changes and risks in a project. I am also responsible for defining use-cases, designing visual data flow diagrams for better team alignment on requirements and collaborating with multiple Team Leads working on different technologies to deliver projects successfully.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KetanGoyal](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KetanGoyal)


**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KetanGoyal/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The goal of the project was to collect and analyze the hardware usage data to make future business decisions about increasing or decreasing nodes in a Linux cluster.To achieve this I developed a system to monitor hardware usage of server nodes in real time using Docker, stored the data in SQL tables using PostgreSQL, did requirement elicitation, and created BRD and SRD for the project. Developed architecture diagrams and data flow diagrams for a better and high-level visual understanding of the project. The project was managed using agile methodology. Also developed a schedule to complete deliverables for signoffs. Conducted daily scrum meetings, managed sprints and kept all the stakeholders updated on time. Source code was managed using Git.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KetanGoyal/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: The goal of this project was to analyze the data from a gift shop and help the business understand their customers and devise a marketing strategy to increase revenue by generating more sales. For this, I conducted meetings with the stakeholders to gather requirements and created a Business requirements document. Developed a schedule to track project execution using agile to complete deliverables for signoffs. Daily scrum meetings, sprints(bi-weekly) were conducted and communicated with stakeholders regularly. The Gift shop was able to provide the customer data in a file and it was loaded on Jarvis warehouse running on PostgreSQL. Data schema modifications were done to allow for more efficient expansion and extension of the dataset . RFM analysis was done to categorize the customers and devise a marketing strategy to increase revenue.


## Highlighted Projects
**Ride Share App like uber**: Conducted meetings with stakeholders to gather business requirements. Created BRD, FRD, Use cases, Data Flow Diagrams, and wireframes for the project. Also collaborated with Team leads working on different technologies to understand the feasibility and complexity of the project in the beginning phase to create a schedule for completing deliverables on time and getting signoffs from the clients while managing project scope and client expectations to mitigate risks. Researched different third party modules to be added to the project to reduce client costs like which payment gateway to integrate.


## Professional Experiences

**Business Analyst, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Worked on projects creating BRDs, SRDs and requirement elicitation along with coding, implementation and testing for Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App and Python Data Analytics. Also analyzed these two projects to make decisions to help improve efficiency of their operations, reduce their operating costs and be able to generate more revenue by analyzing data and generating graphs to better visualize and make comparisons.

**Business Analyst, Infowiz (2016-2017)**: Conducted stakeholder interviews to gather business requirements, and create BRDs and FRDs for these projects. Hold meetings with Team leads of different technologies in conjunction to better understand the project and then define project scope, and develop project deliverable schedule. Create wireframes for UI/UX for different platforms(mobile app/back end). Hold daily scrum meetings with team members and sprint meetings. Get feedback and signoffs from clients after every deliverable and conduct client interviews after project delivery. Stay in touch with the client after project completion to provide support.
