The Gift shop was able to provide the customer data in a file and it was loaded into a Jarvis data warehouse running on PostgreSQL. Data schema modifications were done to allow for more efficient expansion and extension of the dataset. RFM analysis was done using python in Jupyter notebook to categorize the customers and devise a marketing strategy to increase revenue.",

Prior to attending university I was fascinated with technology and focused on mathematics and science in high school. Technical training and natural business acumen helped me get a Business Analyst role at Infowiz in India (based out of California) working with North American clients.\nI'm currently working at Jarvis as a Data Engineer. Here I have been working in a team in an Agile environment working on projects like Linux, SQL, Python and Hadoop. I have an eye for detail and natural intellect in coding. I am very experimental and strive for perfection in my projects by following best practices.\nI sincerely hope that my skills, passion, and work shown here stand out to you. If so, I look forward to speaking with you."
